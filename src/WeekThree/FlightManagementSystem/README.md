Design a system for the management of flights and pilots.

- The airline provides the flights. Every airline has an identity.
- The airline has different types of aircraft.
- Airplanes may be in operation or in a state of maintenance.
- Each flight has a unique identity, departure and landing times, and departure and landing times.
- Every flight has a pilot and co-pilot, and they fly airplanes.
- Airport uniques have IDs and names.
- Airlines have pilots, and each pilot has a level of experience.
- An aircraft type may need a certain number of pilots.
- Draw the Class diagram describing this system.
