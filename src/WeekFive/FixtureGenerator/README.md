Fixture Builder


A class should be written that creates random match fixtures for teams entered with Java.


Rules :


  - Double Term League method will be applied. Each team will play two matches against other teams, at home and away.


  - The left side of the list shows the home team and the right side shows the away team.


- If an odd number of teams is entered, another team named "Mr" must be added to complete the even number. Teams matching Mr. means they will not play that week.
