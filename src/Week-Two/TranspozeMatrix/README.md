# Home Work Seventh -- Transpoz Of Matrix

Write a program in Java that finds the transpose of a matrix constructed with multidimensional arrays.

To transpose the matrix means to swap the same numbered rows and columns of the matrix. The matrix obtained as a result of this operation is the transpose of the original matrix. At this stage, the transpose (transpose) of a kxn matrix becomes an nxk matrix. For example, suppose we have a matrix A. The transpose of this matrix A is denoted by A^T (A to T).

For example, the transpose of the 2x3 matrix A below is a 2x3 matrix A^T.
